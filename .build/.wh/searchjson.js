It doesn't take $$$ spent on physiotherapy or any weird equipment. In just two weeks my struggle with knee pain vanished - and never came back.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                        Before you try anything - visit a doctor\nWarning:\nCuring the wrong problem will not help you much. More likely it will introduce a second problem, which you definitely don't want. Consult with medical personel first!\nNo pain no gain\nThis specific type of pain is a result of body growth. Is it good than? Far from that.\nYour body is an amazing device. It has bones as structure and muscles to move one bone relative to another. A bunch of special fibers called tendons connect the muscles to the bones.   \nWhen you decide to contract you muscles the tendons get as much stress as the muscles themselves. Normally there is a limit on how much force a muscle can produce and your visits to the gym push that limit upwards. The body adapts and the muscle grows. So is the tendon, which adapts to support the bigger force and the stronger muscle.\nBut here is the problem. The muscle grows significantly faster than the tendon, and constant preasure on the muscles makes it stronger, leaving the tendon lagging behind, unable to provide the necessary support for it.\nA set of special exercises for the tendons will address just that. Two weeks of 3x15 repetitions, twice a day and you will be back on your athletic track. I've seen the pain from walking up the stairs completely gone away even after multiple hours training and playing session.\nHelp from the leading authority on knee pain\nBut before I show you this exercise, you should know this: there are many causes for jumpers knee, both obvious and hidden and if you want to prevent it from happening again you should follow a self treatment program which you can find about in the best book on beating patellar tendonitis by Martin Koban:\n\nSingle-leg decline board squat\nResearch suggests that a very effective excercise for curing patellar tendonitis is the decline board single leg squat. This type of exercise puts more preasure on the tendon than on the muscle, causing it to grow and become stronger. \nAll you need is a board with about 25 degrees angle. You can easily make a board like this yourself, taking a wooden peace and putting one side of it on an elevated surface. \nFor progress, you may squat with additional weight in hands or, following Martin Koban's book suggestion, slightly rotate your body.\nRemember, the focus is the descent. Count to five on your way down and use the second leg to assist standing up.\n\nBest knee investment you can get\nPossibly you already have a collection of all types and kinds of knee bandages, holders and ropes.Possibly you spent a lot of time and money on physiotherapy, to get a bit of massage and questionable advices (I got advice: stand on one leg. This is great for stabilizing leg muscles if you forgot how to use legs after an operation, but has nothing to do with patellar tendonitis).\nBut the best result I've got, and by far the cheapest, was to follow the advices by Mark Kuban in his book. From it you'll learn:\n\nWhat causes patellar tendonitis, so you can avoid it and never have knee pain, lose time in recovery not training or not winning because of it.\nHow to continue training inspite of patellar tendonitis, so you don't lose your competitive edge and skills\nHow long it takes to treat it in each of the 4 differest stages of jumpers knee, so you can keep a proper training plan\nWhat can you eat for breakfast to help the tendons all over your body, so your tendons will be able to withstand more games\nGet a step-by-step treatment program which you can follow from pain to 100% recovery in the shortest time, so you don't sit on the bench too long\nAnswers to the most popular questions regarding jumpers knee, so you can find out all you need to know and get rid of it once and for all\n\nTherefore I highly recommend the book Beating Patellar Tendonitis by Mark Koban. For me it was the best investment in my knees health and all of it for less than 20$\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                \n\n    \n        More cool stuff\n    \n    Join Alex's journey to excellence and discover how to become the best athlete you can\n    \n        Train your brain\n        Prepare your body\n        Perfect your game\n        Follow the experience\n        Listen to the experts\n        Other posts","tags":"","loc":"/blogposts/fixing-jumpers-knee/"},

The moment you settle for 3rd place mentally, your brain subsconsiously stops you from even trying harder and chasing those hard balls\n\nSelf confidence is what determines many time the outcome. The technique can be perfect and the injury recovery might be complete but if you don't believe you'll win - you never will\n\nUse a 3-tier goals system\n\nEliminate things preventing your progress (such as everyday parties) and proactively seek opportunities for improvement (such as moving to a place with better volley infrastructure and players)\n\nMove the legs, says Dalhausser, reminding us that volleyball is a leg game\n\nWhen blocking look at the attacker, don't make the mistake of looking just at the ball\n\nConsistency, consistency, consistency in your technique, in your breakfast, in your warmup will keep you at the top for a long run\n\nNow, when the prematch expectations are set, throw them completely out of you head during the match. Focus on the task at hand. Phil suggests you think about how would you react to this or that type of server and never second guess yourself unless you want to put a ball in the net\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                \n\n    \n        More cool stuff\n    \n    Join Alex's journey to excellence and discover how to become the best athlete you can\n    \n        Train your brain\n        Prepare your body\n        Perfect your game\n        Follow the experience\n        Listen to the experts\n        Other posts","tags":"","loc":"/blogposts/here-is-what-phil-dalhausser-thinks-on-setting-expectations/"},
