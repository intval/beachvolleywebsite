											<h2>Fixing jumpers knee</h2>
											<p>Stopping that annoying pain directly under or above the knee cap is easier than you think. It doesn&#39;t take $$$ spent on physiotherapy or any weird equipment. In just two weeks my struggle with knee pain vanished - and never came back.</p>
										</header>
										
                                        <p>Before you try anything - visit a doctor</p>
<h4 id="warning-">Warning:</h4>
<p>Curing the wrong problem will not help you much. More likely it will introduce a second problem, which you definitely don&#39;t want. Consult with medical personel first!</p>
<h4 id="no-pain-no-gain">No pain no gain</h4>
<p>This specific type of pain is a result of body growth. Is it good than? Far from that.</p>
<p>Your body is an amazing device. It has bones as structure and muscles to move one bone relative to another. A bunch of special fibers called tendons connect the muscles to the bones.   </p>
<p>When you decide to contract you muscles the tendons get as much stress as the muscles themselves. Normally there is a limit on how much force a muscle can produce and your visits to the gym push that limit upwards. The body adapts and the muscle grows. So is the tendon, which adapts to support the bigger force and the stronger muscle.</p>
<p>But here is the problem. The muscle grows significantly faster than the tendon, and constant preasure on the muscles makes it stronger, leaving the tendon lagging behind, unable to provide the necessary support for it.</p>
<p>A set of special exercises for the tendons will address just that. Two weeks of 3x15 repetitions, twice a day and you will be back on your athletic track. I&#39;ve seen the pain from walking up the stairs completely gone away even after multiple hours training and playing session.</p>
<h4 id="help-from-the-leading-authority-on-knee-pain">Help from the leading authority on knee pain</h4>
<p>But before I show you this exercise, you should know this: there are many causes for jumpers knee, both obvious and hidden and if you want to prevent it from happening again you should follow a self treatment program which you can find about in the best book on beating patellar tendonitis by Martin Koban:</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/GetRidOfKneePain"><img src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00F9210UI&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=beachvolley08-2" alt="Beating Patellar Tendonitis"></a></p>
<h4 id="single-leg-decline-board-squat">Single-leg decline board squat</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2658963/">Research</a> suggests that a very effective excercise for curing patellar tendonitis is the decline board single leg squat. This type of exercise puts more preasure on the tendon than on the muscle, causing it to grow and become stronger. </p>
<p>All you need is a board with about 25 degrees angle. You can easily make a board like this yourself, taking a wooden peace and putting one side of it on an elevated surface. 
For progress, you may squat with additional weight in hands or, following Martin Koban&#39;s book suggestion, slightly rotate your body.</p>
<p>Remember, the focus is the descent. Count to five on your way down and use the second leg to assist standing up.</p>

<h4 id="best-knee-investment-you-can-get">Best knee investment you can get</h4>
<p>Possibly you already have a collection of all types and kinds of knee bandages, holders and ropes.<br>Possibly you spent a lot of time and money on physiotherapy, to get a bit of massage and questionable advices (I got advice: stand on one leg. This is great for stabilizing leg muscles if you forgot how to use legs after an operation, but has nothing to do with patellar tendonitis).</p>
<p>But the best result I&#39;ve got, and by far the cheapest, was to follow the advices by Mark Kuban in his book. From it you&#39;ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>What causes patellar tendonitis, so you can avoid it and never have knee pain, lose time in recovery not training or not winning because of it.</li>
<li>How to continue training inspite of patellar tendonitis, so you don&#39;t lose your competitive edge and skills</li>
<li>How long it takes to treat it in each of the 4 differest stages of jumpers knee, so you can keep a proper training plan</li>
<li>What can you eat for breakfast to help the tendons all over your body, so your tendons will be able to withstand more games</li>
<li>Get a step-by-step treatment program which you can follow from pain to 100% recovery in the shortest time, so you don&#39;t sit on the bench too long</li>
<li>Answers to the most popular questions regarding jumpers knee, so you can find out all you need to know and get rid of it once and for all</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore I highly recommend the book <a href="http://bit.ly/GetRidOfKneePain">Beating Patellar Tendonitis by Mark Koban</a>. For me it was the best investment in my knees health and all of it for less than 20$</p>
